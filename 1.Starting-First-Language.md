### Starting-First-Language

My personal advice to my juniors and anyone visiting this page would be start off with C++. Then explore and learn any language of your interest.



**I will give you two links below, to download basic C++ books, for those who are new in coding word and do not know any language**

### Initial step in CP

-	Start with a language (preferably C++). Become proficient in that. Follow the sequence
1.	For C++ use Sublime text (preferred)
2.	C++ basics (hello world program, data types, variables, operators and precedence, expressions, bitwise operators and basic programs)
3.	Conditional Statements
4.	Loops
5.	Arrays
6.	Pointers
7.	Strings
8.	Functions\\
Till here, for each topic, read from GeeksforGeeks and solve the small questions there, watch a youtube video, also visit w3school website. And then solve Hackerrank.
Solve lots of questions on patterns formation to get familiar with loops. Clear your conecpts on call by value and call by reference.
Do maintain a copy and make your own notes. Revise the notes and practice the questions topicwise.\\
9.	Now start with OOPs concept
10.	Cover other topics such as STL, Exception handling, IOStreams, Template Functions and Classes etc.
11.	Till now you must have achieved 5star in Hackerrank.
-	Start doing the SPOJ Questions List that is shared.
-	Now you can Start with CP.
1.	Start with DS and Algo (+Maths):
•	Arrays- do all famous questions and concepts on arrays
•	Number Theory
•	Give CodeForces Contests and Codechef Contests.


I’ll be sharing notes and solutions to your doubts in the group. I’ll also give some Books pdf in the group itself. 
Interact as much and hep others with their doubts and errors. This increases your problem-solving ability as well.
